# Sehat Path — Starter Website

This repository contains a minimal, responsive static website for Sehat Path — a dietitian & nutritionist practice. It's meant as a starter template you can customize.

Included files:
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `styles.css` — styling (simple, no framework)
- `script.js` — interactivity: BMI & calories calculator, contact + booking form handling (Formspree placeholders)
- `README.md` — this file

How to use
1. Replace placeholder text like `[Your Name]` with your name and credentials.
2. Replace the Formspree endpoints in `script.js` with your Formspree form ID (`https://formspree.io/f/{your-id}`), or point to your own backend endpoint.
3. Optionally replace the Unsplash hero image with your own images.
4. Preview locally: open `index.html` in a browser.
5. Deploy:
   - GitHub Pages: push to a repository and enable Pages.
   - Vercel/Netlify: connect the repo and deploy as a static site.

Customization ideas
- Add authentication & client portal for intake forms (requires backend).
- Integrate calendar booking (Calendly, Acuity) for live scheduling.
- Add blog or resources pages.
- Add analytics & SEO metadata.

Accessibility & compliance
- This starter pays attention to semantic HTML and accessible labels. For clinical services, ensure any health claims and privacy (e.g., PHI) handling follow local regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) before collecting sensitive data.

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert this to a small React/Next.js app.
- Add an intake questionnaire / PDFs.
- Integrate Stripe for payments or Calendly for bookings.
- Implement a simple Node or serverless backend for contact / client management.
